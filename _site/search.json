However, there has been little to no haze in the region in recent years. This sparked our interest in investigating the occurrences of forest fires in Indonesia.\nUsing geospatial analytics, we can easily download, manipulate, and analyze data with the R programming language. Geospatial analysis is incredibly useful in extracting insights and patterns from spatial data that may otherwise go unnoticed. However, this method is not easily accessible to individuals with little to no coding experience. Additionally, although there is a lot of data available on the internet, it can be tedious to obtain and consolidate, with some websites requiring users to log in to view the data.\nTo address these issues, we created an interactive web application that allows users to carry out analysis simply through interacting with the user interface. By providing an interactive consolidated platform for users to view data and corresponding analyses, we make the data easily accessible while still allowing for customization through the user interface."

In the inhomogenous case, it takes into account the spatial and temporal variation in the intensity of the point process under study. Meanwhile, the homogenous case assumes that the underlying process generating the point pattern is constant in space and time.\nUsers can input a specific sub-district to look for spatiotemporal autocorrelation throughout a specific year. All fields of the filter must be filled before an output can be computed.\nThere are three possible types of outputs, adjusted by the Plot Type selection dropdown: Contour, Image, and Perspective.\n\nContourImagePerspective\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor perspective plots, there are two additional parameters that can be adjusted: azimuthal angle and colatitude.

    "text": "1. Abstract\nThis project involves conducting Spatial Point Pattern Analysis on forest fires in Indonesia. Specifically, we will analyze Indonesian forest fire hotspot data using this method. For this project, a hotspot is defined as a location with a higher temperature than its surroundings as defined by the Indonesian Meteorology, Climatology, and Geophysical Agency.\nThe goal of the project is to create a web application that aims to aid users in performing exploratory data analysis, kernel density estimation, first-order spatial point pattern analysis, second-order spatial point pattern analysis, and spatiotemporal area analysis.\nThe user will be able to make use of the data from all these analysis without needing to write a single of line of code, or needing in depth knowledge about the dataset in the first place, allowing usage of the analysis data for studies or other purposes."
